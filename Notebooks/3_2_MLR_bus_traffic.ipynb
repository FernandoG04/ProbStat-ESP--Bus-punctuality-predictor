    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having observed that weather conditions do not have a significant impact on the end delay of STM buses, we will attempt to build a model that also includes traffic data to see if it can improve the model's predictive ability. The new model will include the same weather and bus data as the previous unfiltered model. This data will be combined with the traffic data from the City of Montreal, containing data points from November 26, 2019 to September 9, 2023. [See master + traffic dataset description](../Data/Dataset_descriptions.md). A sample of the data is shown below.\n",

    "The correlation heatmap shows that the traffic data has some significant correlations with the delay at the end of the trip. The strongest correlations, excluding coded traffic columns, are with the total traffic (~0.17) and the delay at the start of the trip (~0.11). The correlations are still relatively weak, so we do not expect the traffic data to have definitive predictive ability. Note that the traffic at each direction and turn have greater correlations with the delay at the end of the trip than the total traffic. This is expected since bus routes have a fixed direction, so the traffic in the opposite direction should not affect the bus. However, the high correlations between all the coded traffic columns indicate that there is a lot of multicollinearity in these portions of the data. We will opt to use the total traffic as the sole traffic predictor to avoid multicollinearity issues. The model summary is shown in Table 3.2.2. \n",

The models with significantly low adjusted R-squared values are bus lines 467, 67, and 121 ($R^2_{adj}<-0.100$). Considering that the p-values for their coefficients are also not significant, conclusions cannot be drawn from these models. The models with adjusted R-squared values greater than 0.100 are bus lines 100, 460, and 439. The p-values for the coefficients of these models are significant, with an exception of the temperature at the start of the trip for bus line 439.
